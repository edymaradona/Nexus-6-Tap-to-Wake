#Nexus 6 Tap to Wake

###Description
Android app which enables the "double tap to wake" feature that the Nexus 6 shipped with. It requires root, so you must unlock your bootloader and root before using this.

###Caveats
The built in implementation of double tap to wake isn't perfect. Some users have indicated that if their device has been sleeping for a while, it isn't always reliable. It is very unlikely to cause harm to your Nexus 6, but extensive longterm testing has not yet been done. By downloading now, you are accepting the liability if something were to go wrong. Please let me know if you run into any issues or have any questions.

###Changelog
####Version 1.1
 * Settings now persist through reboot.
 * Changed name from "Doubletap to Unlock" to "Doubletap to Wake".
 * Updated Icon. Doesn't look amazing, but it's better than it was.
 * Updated some text.

####Version 1.0
 * Implemented the ability to turn on or off Double Tap to Wake
