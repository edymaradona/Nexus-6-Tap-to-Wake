    <!-- Informative Messages -->
    <string name="description">This app enables the double tap to wake feature.
    It is only intended for the Nexus 4, and should not be run on any other device.
    Extensive testing has not been completed, so while this shouldn\'t harm your device,
    use it at your own risk. Changes persist through reboot, so you shouldn\'t need to open
    this again. However, if you uninstall this app, then double tap to wake will be disabled
    upon rebooting.</string>
